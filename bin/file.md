Docker daemon manages all the services by communicating with other daemons. It manages docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes with the help of the API requests of Docker.
What is Docker Daemon? Docker Client With the help of the docker client, the docker users can interact with the docker. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with multiple daemons. When a docker client runs any docker command on the docker terminal then the terminal sends instructions to the daemon. The Docker daemon gets those instructions from the docker client withinside the shape of the command and REST APIâ€™s request.
